nate: Hey Hector.
hector: Hello Nathaniel. How's your progress?

- What am I supposed to be doing again?
# id: remind_goal
nate: What am I supposed to be doing again?
hector: The Temporal Synchronizer is broken, Nathaniel.
hector: We need a replacement clock mechanism to get it operational.
hector: Without it, the experiment cannot proceed.

- What's this big experiment for?
# once
nate: So what's this big experiment actually for?
hector: Ah, an excellent question!
hector: We're attempting to create a stable temporal-spatial gateway.
hector: Think of it as a doorway through time and space, but with significantly less screaming than usual.
hector: Well, theoretically less screaming.

- Is what we're doing dangerous?
# once
nate: Is what we're doing dangerous?
hector: Dangerous? No, no, no.
hector: Well... perhaps mildly hazardous.
hector: Possibly moderately perilous.
hector: Let's just say the safety protocols are more like "safety suggestions."
hector: But don't worry! I've only had to evacuate the lab twice this month.

- What do you do for fun around here?
# once
nate: What do you do for fun around here in the middle of nowhere?
hector: Fun? Nathaniel, I conduct SCIENCE.
hector: Although... Earl and I do play dominoes on Thursdays.
hector: He's surprisingly strategic for someone with such large fingers.
hector: Last week he beat me three games in a row. I suspect foul play.

- I should get back to work.
nate: I should get back to work.
hector: Excellent initiative, Nathaniel. The synchronizer won't fix itself!
