hector: Nathaniel! Perfect timing. We are almost ready to kick off the most dangerous experiment of my career. Again.
hector: There is just one problem. The Temporal Synchronizer is missing its core mechanism, and without it, the portal cannot achieve stable resonance.
hector: If we fire it up in this condition, we will have a repeat of last Tuesday. And nobody wants that.
nate: What happened last Tuesday?
hector: The important thing is that eyebrows grow back. Most of them.
hector: I need you to find a suitable replacement component while I finish my calculations. Can you do that?
nate: I... sure. What am I looking for, exactly?
hector: Something precise. Mechanical. Keeps very accurate time. You will know it when you see it.

hector: Nathaniel. Progress report?
nate: Still looking.
hector: The portal is not going to stabilize itself.

- What's the Temporal Synchronizer?
# id: asked_about_synchronizer
nate: Before I go hunting for mystery components — what exactly is a Temporal Synchronizer? What does it look like?
hector: Excellent question. The Temporal Synchronizer is a chrono-calibration module responsible for maintaining precise phase alignment across the dimensional resonance array.
hector: Think of it as the heartbeat of the portal. Without it, the oscillation frequency drifts, the stabilization field collapses, and reality becomes... negotiable.
nate: So it's a clock?
hector: It is a HIGHLY SPECIALIZED chronometric interface unit.
hector: ...that keeps time.
hector: It is a clock, yes. But a very important one.

- Remind me — what is the Temporal Synchronizer again?
# requires: asked:asked_about_synchronizer
nate: Okay, I blanked. The Temporal Synchronizer is...?
hector: A clock, Nathaniel.
nate: Right. A clock.
hector: A highly specialized one.
nate: Obviously.

- What went wrong with the experiment?
# once
nate: Last time we ran this experiment — what exactly happened? You mentioned Tuesday.
hector: There was a minor miscalibration in the resonance frequency.
nate: Is "minor miscalibration" a euphemism?
hector: The Temporal Synchronizer exploded. There was some screaming. A localized temporal anomaly formed over my workbench and persisted for approximately forty-five minutes.
hector: On the positive side, I now know with great precision what not to do.
nate: That is almost reassuring.
hector: Almost! Yes. You are learning.

- What exactly am I supposed to be doing again?
nate: Okay, just to confirm my objectives — I am looking for a replacement clock mechanism. And then what?
hector: Find the clock, bring it back here, install it in the Temporal Synchronizer housing. It will click into place. Very satisfying.
hector: Then we run the experiment, achieve stable dimensional resonance for the first time in recorded history, and science wins.
hector: Simple. Elegant. Almost certainly not catastrophic.
nate: Almost certainly.
hector: I would put it at eighty percent. Which is extremely high for this kind of research.

- Let me look around.
# set: story.intro_complete
nate: Alright. I'll see what I can find.
hector: Excellent. I will be here, making calculations. Definitely not anxiously checking the readings every thirty seconds.
