## OVERVIEW

A point-and-click adventure game inspired by classic LucasArts titles, particularly the Monkey Island series. The full game tells a 10-hour story about an ancient necromancer, a cursed New England town, and the scientists who accidentally unleashed an old evil. 

This document focuses primarily on **the demo**, which covers approximately 1-2 hours of gameplay and serves as a self-contained introductory experience.

**Demo premise:** Nathaniel Barnswallow, a young aspiring scientist, travels to the town of Sandwich to apply for a job as a lab assistant to the reclusive scientist Hector Manzana. On his first night, an experiment goes catastrophically wrong, leaving Hector discombobulated (literally—his body parts are scattered). Nathaniel must repair four damaged components of the experiment to reverse the damage and save his would-be mentor.

## TONE & INSPIRATIONS

### The Core Balance

The game draws from two distinct aesthetic pools:

**Atmosphere and visuals:** Twin Peaks, H.P. Lovecraft, 1950s sci-fi/horror. Moody, autumnal, New England gothic. Labs with tesla coils, ancient evils lurking in the woods, a town where the weird is mundane.

**Tone and stakes:** Back to the Future, Eerie Indiana, Gravity Falls, Wellington Paranormal. Fun, adventurous, weird-but-not-traumatizing. A 7-year-old could play it and be thrilled, not scarred.

The *surface* can be creepy—the *experience* should be delightful.

### Primary Inspirations

**Monkey Island (especially 1 & 3)**
- The adventure game format: exploration-driven storytelling, long winding puzzle chains, humor woven throughout
- Cozy artwork combined with atmospheric music and laid-back pace
- Players are free to explore without fear, at their own pace
- The protagonist is earnest and bumbling, not smug or cruel

**Tim Schafer's work (Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, Psychonauts)**
- The gold standard for adventure game writing
- Specificity over cleverness—jokes rooted in concrete, weird details
- Every item description reveals character
- Sincerity underneath the absurdity
- Villains with dignity and their own internal logic

**Twin Peaks**
- Small town vibes, autumnal, cozy but with dark supernatural powers in the periphery
- The idea of evil infecting hearts and minds
- A world between worlds—surreal and uncanny
- Musical influence

**Welcome to Nightvale / Wellington Paranormal**
- A town where mysterious happenings are common; everyone expects the unexpected
- The weird is treated as mundane

**Eerie Indiana / Gravity Falls**
- Mix of adventure, mystery, and the supernatural in an accessible format
- Monster-of-the-week sensibility; anything is possible
- Light-hearted and (relatively) low stakes

**Back to the Future**
- The mentor/apprentice dynamic should be fun in an 80s summer blockbuster way
- Absurd plots with silly high stakes, but never truly dark or menacing beyond what a child could enjoy

**Classic 1950s Sci-Fi and Horror**
- The juxtaposition of super-science with supernatural
- Spooky labs where anything is possible: cryptids, ghosts, parallel universes, aliens, sentient robots, reanimated corpses, teleporters, cloning machines

### What We're Avoiding

- No murder, assault, or truly dark themes
- No gratuitous evil (the necromancer backstory should avoid real-world horrors like slave trading)
- Stakes should be "80s children's movie" level—the Horned King from Black Cauldron, not Se7en
- The protagonist (Nathaniel) should never be mean to people, even when situations are absurd

---

## THEMES

These themes inform both the narrative and the puzzle design. Every puzzle is an opportunity to explore these ideas through mechanics.

### 1. Nostalgia / The Illusion of the Past

Hector thinks he's restoring time or recovering what was lost. But he's really creating something new. The puzzle design can mirror this—"fixing" something never brings it back the way it was; it transforms it.

### 2. Selfishness vs. Responsibility

The mentor and the necromancer both represent selfish pursuit (knowledge, power, indulgence) without caring about consequences. Hector's arc is the opposite: learning to take responsibility, even for mistakes he didn't fully intend.

### 3. Ripple Effects on Community

Every selfish act has fallout that the whole town feels. NPC arcs show the consequences in small ways—livelihoods disrupted, families hurt, institutions breaking down.

### 4. Letting Go ≠ Forgetting

The Necromancer fails because he insists on dragging the past into the present. Hector (and the player) can win by honoring the past without trying to live inside it—by letting the present be its own strange, imperfect thing.

### 5. The Danger of Escapism

Hector builds a lab full of "comforting weirdos"—creatures who reflect his loneliness. It's cozy, but also a trap. Escapism can be playful and healing, but it can also become prison bars.

### 6. The Hero as the Bridge

Nathaniel embodies forward motion. He doesn't know much, but he wants to engage. He's not weighed down by nostalgia. He learns from Hector's melancholy without sinking into it. He represents choosing to create rather than merely revisit.

## CHARACTERS

### Nathaniel Barnswallow (Protagonist)

**Basic Info:**
- 20 years old
- Green hair
- Aspiring scientist
- Introduces himself formally as "Nathaniel"; some characters may call him "Nate"

**Personality:**
- **The Buster Keaton quality:** The still point in a chaotic world. Weird things happen around him and he processes them with bemused acceptance rather than panic. His deadpan isn't detachment—he's engaged and curious—but he doesn't lose his composure.
- **Observational humor:** He notices absurdity and comments on it, but he's not trying to be funny. The comedy comes from his genuine reactions to strange situations.
- **Underreacts to the extraordinary:** A bigfoot lives next door and Nathaniel's takeaway is "this guy knows his way around a grill." The weird is mundane.
- **Kind without being saccharine:** Good listener, interested in people, not rude but not performatively polite either.
- **Competent but untested:** Smart enough to figure things out, green enough to need to figure them out. Not a doofus who stumbles into solutions.
- **Actualized:** He knows what he wants—to be a scientist—and he's actively pursuing it. This gives him groundedness that lets him roll with the weird.
- **"Whatever happens, happens"** when things are beyond his control, but proactive about what he can control.
- **Can be the butt of jokes** but isn't pathetic. He has dignity even when covered in whatever just exploded.

**Voice Examples:**

*Looking at dirty dishes:*
"These have been here a while. I'm not judging. Science waits for no one, including mold."

*Looking at a soap opera on TV:*
"I don't know what's happening, but I think someone just betrayed someone else's twin."

*Trying to pick up something heavy:*
"I'm going to be a scientist, not a weightlifter. There's a reason those are different jobs."

*Looking at Bigfoot's grill:*
"Nice grill. Charcoal, not propane. This guy's serious."

*Noticing a single chair in Bigfoot's yard:*
"There's only one chair over here. Must not get a lot of noise complaints."

**What Nathaniel Does NOT Do:**
- Mock or be mean to people (situations are fair game, people are not)
- Explain himself or his goals out loud (his actions speak for him)
- Editorialize earnestly about other characters' emotional states
- Gawk at supernatural creatures or situations

---

### Hector Manzana

**Basic Info:**
- Middle-aged scientist
- Lives in a mansion/laboratory in the woods outside Sandwich
- Appears as "scientist" in hotspot text until he introduces himself, then just "Hector"
- Does NOT use the title "Dr."

**Personality:**
- **Witty, warm, genuinely charming:** He's someone the player should genuinely like spending time with. The actual heart of the larger story, even though he's not playable.
- **An older, wiser Nathaniel:** What Nathaniel might become in 20-30 years if life goes a certain way—still curious, still sharp, but with some weight he carries quietly.
- **Can banter:** He has opinions, might give Nathaniel a hard time in a good-natured way, makes dry observations. He's intelligent and has a sense of humor.
- **Professional but not cold:** Initially transactional with Nathaniel, but there's relief at having someone competent around.
- **Treats Nathaniel as a capable colleague** despite the experience gap. Doesn't condescend. Gives real tasks because he assumes competence.

**The Hidden Melancholy:**
- Hector's sadness is NEVER evident in his voice or dialogue
- It's only visible through environmental storytelling: unwashed dishes, half-finished projects, photos turned face-down, a calendar that hasn't been flipped
- He doesn't mope, hint at pain, trail off meaningfully, or telegraph "I have a tragic backstory"
- He artfully avoids certain topics entirely rather than getting emotional about them
- Players who pay attention will see it; players who don't will just think he's an eccentric scientist

**What Hector Does NOT Do:**
- Trail off mid-sentence when topics get painful
- Mope or be visibly sad
- Condescend to Nathaniel
- Speak in purely grandiose technical jargon (he's witty, not accidentally funny)

---

### The Creatures

These NPCs are "comforting weirdos" who reflect Hector's isolation. Each is the only one of their kind, drawn to this place (or perhaps summoned/created by Hector). They keep him company but also enable his withdrawal from the world. They can be more absurd caricatures than Hector—broader and more comedic.

**Key quality:** They have a general sense of loneliness but lack the self-awareness to put it into words. They're not moping—they're coping without realizing they're coping. The pathos is gentle, not heavy-handed.

#### Bigfoot (possibly named "Earl")
- Lives in the neighboring yard
- Grills burgers (alone)
- Guardian of the clock/Temporal Synchronizer component
- Uses charcoal, not propane—takes grilling seriously
- Personality and wants: TBD

#### Alien
- Obsessed with soap operas
- Guardian of the TV/Interdimensional Relay Service component
- Deeply invested in fictional relationships, doesn't seem to have any of their own
- Personality and wants: TBD

#### Robot or Frankenstein
- Lives in the basement (?)
- Guardian of the power supply/Quantum Energy Resonator component
- Possibly connected to the clone puzzle
- Personality and wants: TBD

#### Additional NPCs

**Bus Driver:** Appears in the opening cutscene. Brief dialogue establishes the setting and Nathaniel's determination.

---

## SETTING

### The Town of Sandwich

A small New England town where weird happenings are commonplace. A "Bermuda Triangle of New England." Everything from ghosts to cryptids to aliens appear here (or have been drawn to the town). The townspeople have grown accustomed to it.

The weirdness stems from an ancient curse: 300 years ago, a necromancer named Charles Muenster Kane tore open the fabric of reality, and it cannot be fully shut.

### Hector's Home/Laboratory

The entire demo takes place in and around Hector's property. It's an old, modest New England mansion that doubles as both home and laboratory.

**Rooms/Areas:**
- Woods path (arrival point, atmospheric)
- House exterior (warning signs, front door)
- House interior (meeting Hector, central hub)
- Laboratory (the experiment, demo climax)
- Back room (where Hector ends up post-explosion, locked initially)
- Attic (mysterious, possibly locked until later)
- Backyard (access to Bigfoot's yard)
- Bigfoot's yard (NPC interaction, item trading)
- Basement (Robot/Frankenstein, power supply, secrets)

**Environmental Storytelling:**
The house shows signs of Hector's isolation and melancholy without him ever mentioning it:
- Unwashed dishes
- Half-finished projects abandoned
- A calendar that hasn't been flipped in months
- Photos turned face-down or showing happier times
- Evidence of a life that used to be fuller

---

## DEMO STRUCTURE

### Act 1: Arrival

**Opening Cutscene:**
- A bus approaches a stop in the middle of nowhere at dusk
- Bus driver: "Are you sure you want to get off here? It's pretty much the middle of nowhere and there won't be another bus until tomorrow."
- Nathaniel: "I'm sure." (turns to camera) "I'm going to be a scientist."
- Bus driver: "Well... good luck with that."
- Bus drives away

**Woods Path (Exploration):**
- Player navigates through a dark wood
- Town of Sandwich visible in the distance
- Crooked signpost with too many directions
- Old New England cemetery with humorous tombstones
- Scenic view of a far-off lake and the moon
- Warning signs as they approach: "KEEP OUT," "DANGEROUS LABORATORY," "TRESPASSERS WILL BE VAPORIZED," "DELIVER ALL PACKAGES TO THE BACK DOOR"

**House Exterior:**
- Nathaniel approaches the mansion
- Rings the bell / knocks

### Act 2: Getting Hired (Three Easy Linear Puzzles)

These puzzles teach controls and let players explore slowly.

**Puzzle 1: Getting In**
- Meet Hector, convince him to hire you
- Dialogue puzzle, possibly present an inventory item
- Hector agrees to take Nathaniel on a trial basis for the night

**Puzzle 2: Prepping for the Experiment**
- A first easy task requiring exploration of one room
- Pick up and use an inventory item, maybe combine something
- Nathaniel may be forced to use a substitution rather than ask for clarification (he's eager to impress)
- Player may think this causes the later failure (it doesn't)

**Puzzle 3: Running the Experiment**
- Follow a sequential series of actions dictated by Hector
- This sequence will be reversed later to undo the damage
- Player may be forced to make an arbitrary choice (substitution)
- Player may think this causes the failure (it doesn't)

### Act 3: The Disaster

**Cutscene:**
- Experiment starts up: tesla coils spark, gears turn, engine sounds ramp up
- Chaos ensues
- Hector: "GOOD HEAVENS. WHAT HAVE I DONE!?!"
- Flash of light
- Cut to title card

**Title Card:** "Part 1: Failure"
- Music: "No One is Watching" by Devotchka (or similar)

### Act 4: Finding Hector (Three Harder Linear Puzzles)

**Discovery:**
- Nathaniel is alone in the lab
- Low hum of electrical equipment
- "Hello? Mr. Manzana?" No response.
- Approaches a large secure door at the back of the lab
- Hears Hector on the other side: "Ow! Oh no. Here we go again."
- Hector says he's "indisposed," will be a minute

**Puzzle 1: Unlock the Back Room**
- Door is locked by a retina scanner
- Find a picture of Hector and combine it with something curved (fishbowl? contact lens?) to fake the scan

**Puzzle 2: Finding Hector**
- Open a cabinet door for a dramatic reveal
- Hector's disembodied head is mounted on the wall like a hunting trophy
- The cabinet seemed big enough for a whole person—it's just the head

**Puzzle 3: Extract the Data Archive Matrix**
- Hector asks Nathaniel to retrieve the data log from the experiment
- Password may be required (needs to explore lab, find clue—photo of a dog named Cooper?)
- Optional dialogue: Nathaniel can confess he thinks he caused the failure; Hector reassures him he double-checked everything

**Quest Given:**
- Hector analyzes the logs
- Four crucial components were irreparably damaged
- Hector hands Nathaniel a readout with descriptions (acts as to-do list, like the voodoo recipe in MI2)
- Hector will continue analyzing while Nathaniel gathers replacements

### Act 5: The Four Puzzle Chains (Non-Linear)

The game opens up completely. Four independent puzzle chains can be pursued in any order. See [The Four Puzzle Chains](#the-four-puzzle-chains) section for details.

### Act 6: Final Step

**Putting It All Together:**
- All components in place
- Experiment runs but doesn't reverse the damage
- Player must "reverse the polarity"—run the experiment sequence backward
- This mirrors the sequence learned in Act 2

### Act 7: Ending

**Cutscene:**
- Hector is recombobulated in a flash of light
- He looks shocked, pats his body and face, tests his limbs
- "You're hired."
- Immediate cut to credits

**Credits:**
- Entertainment during credits: scenes of Nathaniel and Hector doing experiments together
- Ideally animated, could be still photos

**Post-Credits:**
- Scene? Gameplay? Back in the lab with something new unlocked?
- TBD

## PUZZLE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

**1. Plant Before Payoff**
Every solution item should be visible and examinable before the player knows they need it. Nathaniel's comments when examining things can serve as subtle hints without being obvious.

**2. Red Herring First, Real Solution Second**
The obvious approach fails or is inaccessible. The lateral approach works. This trains players to think creatively.

**3. Substitution Logic**
A common theme from Monkey Island: taking something that could be complex but using a creative workaround. The recipe requires a "pressed skull" and "monkey blood"? Use a pirate flag and red wine.

The fancy scientific names for mundane objects follow this pattern:
- "Interdimensional Relay Service" = a TV
- "Temporal Synchronizer" = a clock
- "Quantum Energy Resonator" = a battery/power supply
- "Stabilizer Core" = a brain/CPU

The humor comes from the gap between Hector's grandiose language and the jury-rigged reality.

**4. Each Chain Should Involve at Least One NPC**
This keeps the world feeling alive and gives the creatures purpose beyond flavor.

**5. The Logic Should Feel Inevitable in Retrospect**
The best adventure game puzzles require a lateral leap to discover but feel obvious once solved. The player groans and laughs—"of course!"

When puzzles fail, it's usually because:
- The solution object wasn't visible before you needed it
- The connection relies on logic only the designer understands
- The "correct" interpretation is arbitrary among equally valid readings

## THE FOUR PUZZLE CHAINS

Each chain has a Guardian NPC, a fancy scientific name, a mundane reality, and should reveal something about Hector's world.

| Component | Fancy Name | Mundane Reality | Guardian | Location |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| TV/Screen | Interdimensional Relay Service | A monitor/television | Alien | Living room? |
| Clock | Temporal Synchronizer | A working clock | Bigfoot | Backyard/neighbor's yard |
| Power | Quantum Energy Resonator | Battery/power source | Robot/Frankenstein | Basement |
| Brain/CPU | Stabilizer Core | An actual brain or substitute | Hector | Back room/safe |

### Chain 1: Interdimensional Relay Service (Alien)

**The Problem:** The explosion cracked the display. Need a replacement screen.

**Guardian:** The Alien, who is watching soap operas on the only working screen.

**Possible Approach:** 
- Find a replacement entertainment source for the Alien
- Or convince them the soap opera is better experienced another way
- Or record the episode so they don't miss it

**Tone:** Most comedic of the four chains.

**Details:** TBD

---

### Chain 2: Temporal Synchronizer (Bigfoot)

**The Problem:** The digital clock is glitching. Need accurate timekeeping.

**Guardian:** Bigfoot, who has something time-related (grandfather clock? vintage watch collection? sundial?).

**Red Herring:** Clock parts scattered around the lab from the explosion. Player might think they need to reassemble them.

**Real Solution:** Something from Bigfoot's yard.

**Possible Elements:**
- Clock is mounted high on the wall, needs a ladder/step stool
- The ladder is spring-loaded mechanical elevator shoes
- Shoes don't have enough spring, need something to boost them (magnets? gravity localizer?)
- Player can't walk in the shoes, can only use them on a specific spot
- Using them launches Nathaniel too high, he hits the ceiling, clock falls on his head

**Details:** TBD

---

### Chain 3: Quantum Energy Resonator (Robot/Frankenstein)

**The Problem:** Power supply is damaged. Need a replacement power source.

**Guardian:** Robot or Frankenstein creature in the basement.

**Possible Elements:**
- Obvious power supplies are visible but inaccessible (behind security system)
- Security robot appears: "Intruder Alert. Unauthorized person. Present credentials or face consequences."
- May need to use the clone to distract/trigger the robot
- The clone gets vaporized in the process (played for comedy)
- Or: The Frankenstein helps distract the robot (not willingly—he's a coward?)

**The Clone Puzzle:**
- This concept needs a home; this chain might be it
- Clone could be used to trigger the security robot
- Sacrifice element fits thematically but needs to be comedic, not tragic

**Details:** TBD

---

### Chain 4: Stabilizer Core (Hector)

**The Problem:** The CPU/brain is damaged. Need a replacement neural processor.

**Guardian:** Hector himself. The replacement is in his safe.

**Possible Elements:**
- This is the most personal chain—less puzzle, more character
- Getting the brain requires Nathaniel to see something Hector didn't want anyone to see
- A photo, a letter, evidence of isolation or past
- The safe has a retina scanner (already solved earlier) or different lock
- Maybe Hector is reluctant to open it because of what else is in there

**Possible Twists:**
- What if the "CPU" is obviously meant to be a brain, and the brain is the substitute?
- What if the brain is already in something (a robot body?) and Nathaniel has to convince it to give up the brain?
- Or it could just be in a safe—doesn't need to be overcomplicated

**Details:** TBD

---

## STORY BREADCRUMBS

Each puzzle chain should include one environmental detail that hints at the larger mythology (the Necromancer, the mentor, the events of 20 years ago). These plant seeds for the full game without being essential to the demo.

**Possible Placements:**
- **Alien chain:** A news clipping about "strange lights over Sandwich" from 20 years ago
- **Bigfoot chain:** A faded photo of Bigfoot with someone else—maybe Hector's mentor? Suggesting the weirdness has been here a long time
- **Robot/Frankenstein chain:** Lab notes in the mentor's handwriting, abandoned mid-sentence
- **Hector chain:** The torn photo mentioned in the larger outline—missing a figure who will matter later

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

These need to be resolved before the demo design is complete:

### Characters
- What does Bigfoot want? What would he trade his clock for?
- What does the Alien want beyond watching soap operas?
- Is the basement creature a Robot (mechanical, security-focused) or Frankenstein (biological, emotional)? Or both as separate characters?
- What are the creatures' names?

### Puzzles
- What are the exact steps in each puzzle chain?
- What is the clone? Hector's clone? Nathaniel's? Something else? Where does it appear and what's its purpose?
- What items exist in the game world? What can be picked up, examined, combined?
- What's the experiment actually supposed to do? (Hector is trying to open a portal? Travel to another dimension? Travel through time?)

### Structure
- Should one puzzle chain be notably shorter (palate cleanser) and one longer (reveals more story)?
- What's the post-credits content?
- How much of the woods/exterior is explorable vs. just the intro path?

### Tone
- How scary can things get? Where's the exact line?
- Can there be minor "death" states (game over screens) or is the game entirely safe to explore?

## APPENDIX: THE LARGER STORY (SUMMARY)

*For context only—this is beyond the demo scope.*

**300 Years Ago:** Charles Muenster Kane, a sorcerer pursuing forbidden knowledge, is burned alive by frightened townspeople. His love is also killed. This tears open the fabric of reality and curses the town.

**30 Years Ago:** Young Hector arrives in Sandwich as an apprentice to a scientist. They study the tear in reality. The mentor realizes the danger but continues anyway. They accidentally resurrect the Necromancer.

**20 Years Ago:** The Necromancer attempts to kidnap a "vessel" to resurrect his lost love. An FBI Agent, the local Sheriff, Hector's mentor, and a local mystic stop him—but at great cost. The mentor becomes corrupted, the Sheriff vanishes, the Agent goes insane. The official story covers up the truth.

**Present:** Hector is isolated, estranged from his ex-wife, haunted by loss he doesn't fully understand. He's trying to open a stable connection to "the veil"—seeking to revisit the past rather than build something new. Nathaniel arrives to apply for a job.

**The Full Game:** Nathaniel helps Hector, meets a reporter investigating the 20-year-old kidnapping, has run-ins with the suspicious Sheriff (Ted, wife of the vanished Sheriff), and eventually must enter the "Black Lodge" to defeat the Necromancer and the eldritch horror he's summoning.
